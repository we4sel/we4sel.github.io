If youâ€™re looking for me on the air your best bet is via  [JS8](http://js8call.com/)  on 7.078mHz. My station stays on the air as near 24/7/365 as the weather and lightning allow. If there's lighting in view on  [THIS MAP]([http://www.lightningmaps.org/?lang=en#y=34.0379;x=-88.9081;z=9;t=2;m=oss;r=0;s=15;o=0;b=68.93;d=2;dl=2;dc=0;ts=0;tr=1;](http://www.lightningmaps.org/?lang=en#y=34.0379;x=-88.9081;z=9;t=2;m=oss;r=0;s=15;o=0;b=68.93;d=2;dl=2;dc=0;ts=0;tr=1;)) there's a very good chance my station will be off.

Please leave a message and repeat until you receive an ack from my station please.  Sometimes, for the various reasons that are ham radio, messages may not get thru the first time, or first several times.

I occasionally work CW, with computer assistance for very bad ears. Almost any other digital mode is available if it can be run on a rpi and can be set up by the malfunctioning nut on the station keyboard.



## The station specs:

-   Raspberry Pi 3b+ running Raspbian
-   IC-7300 at 100w barefoot max
-   MFJ-939 Autotuner
-   Home-brew 80-10 Off Center Fed Dipole, poorly built but accidentally works pretty well anyway.
-   30 foot tall mast from scrounged and salvaged materials.  
- Solar power
	- 8*165w panels
	- Salvaged lead-acid storage batteries (not nearly enough)
