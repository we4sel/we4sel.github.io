<h3 id="on-the-air">ON THE AIR</h3>
<p>If youâ€™re looking for me on the air, your best bet is via <a href="http://js8call.com/">JS8</a> on 7.078mHz.  My station stays on the air as near 24/7/365 as the weather and lightning allow. Please leave a message and repeat until you receive an ack from my station please.   <em>Sometimes, for the various reasons that are ham radio, messages may not get thru the first time, or first several times.</em></p>

<p>I occasionally work CW, with computer assistance for very bad ears. Almost any other digital mode is avilable if it can be run on a rpi and can be set up by the malfunctioning nut on the station keyboard.</p>
