### ON THE AIR

If youâ€™re looking for me on the air, your best bet is via  [JS8](http://js8call.com/)  on 7.078mHz. My station stays on the air as near 24/7/365 as the weather and lightning allow. Please leave a message and repeat until you receive an ack from my station please.  _Sometimes, for the various reasons that are ham radio, messages may not get thru the first time, or first several times._

I occasionally work CW, with computer assistance for very bad ears. Almost any other digital mode is avilable if it can be run on a rpi and can be set up by the malfunctioning nut on the station keyboard.
