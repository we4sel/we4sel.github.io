## Welcome to WE4SEL's corner



### "If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility."  â€• Henry Wadsworth Longfellow


So here you have it. Byron, WE4SEL (formerly KG5JVF), radio, projects, problems, etc. 

The station specs: 
- Raspberry Pi 3b+ running Raspbian
- IC-7300 100w barefoot max
- MFJ-939 Autotuner
- Homebrew 80-10 Off Center Fed Dipole, poorly built but accidentally works pretty well anyway.
- 30 foot tall mast from scrounged and salvaged materials. 

### ON THE AIR
If you're looking for me on the air, your best bet is via [JS8](http://js8call.com/) on 7.078mHz.  My station stays on the air as near 24/7/365 as the weather and lightning allow. Please leave a message and repeat until you receive an ack from my station please.   *Sometimes, for the various reasons that are ham radio, messages may not get thru the first time, or first several times.*

I occasionally work CW, with computer assistance for very bad ears. Almost any other digital mode is avilable if it can be run on a rpi and can be set up by the malfunctioning nut on the station keyboard.
